  First, you would need to have node.js install. Then run it in VS code and open the terminal in there. Make sure that you are in the correct file and you have all the required dependents installed. Once you do, type in node {yourFileName.js} and a series of questions will pop up for you to answer.

  Note, {yourFileName.js} is the name of your file.
